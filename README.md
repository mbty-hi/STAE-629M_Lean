# Introduction to Logic: exercises (Lean edition)
Lean version of exercises for the STÆ-629M course (University of Iceland).

This repository assumes some degree of familiarity with Lean. It does *not* provide any information
regarding the system: if you need that, please turn to online sources; see
https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html for pointers. Remember that pen-and-paper proofs
are also accepted.

The exercises are found in `Logic/Basic.lean`. The `Logic/Bonus.lean` presents an explicit encoding
of natural deduction within Lean, you may check it out if you are curious but you do not have to.
